<!-- I'm a Visiting Robotics Researcher at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, developing robotic autonomy algorithms for autonomous exploration of extreme environments. I'm interested in enabling robots to autonomously learn, adapt, and plan in complex real-world environments.

I recently completed a joint Master's thesis at NASA JPL and in Autonomous System Lab (ASL) at ETH Zurich, supervised by Dr. Ali Agha, Dr. Juan Nieto, and Prof. Roland Siegwart. Before graduate school, I studied Electrical Engineering, focusing on Robotics and Control, at Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB).   -->

I’m a PhD student in Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University, focusing on robotics and autonomous systems. My research focuses on learning and decision-making for autonomous systems navigating complex real-world environments.

Prior to Stanford, I was a Visiting Robotics Researcher at NASA JPL, developing autonomy algorithms for autonomous exploration of extreme environments, including the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. I completed a joint Master’s thesis at NASA JPL and in Autonomous System Lab (ASL) at ETH Zurich, supervised by Dr. Ali Agha, Dr. Juan Nieto, and Prof. Roland Siegwart.
